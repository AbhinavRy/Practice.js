### Identification of Problem
MSMEs in India plays an indispensable role in the economic development of the nation through 
contribution to the manufacturing output, increasing foreign exchange earnings, provision of 
employment opportunities, exports, and promoting balanced economic development India has 
about 36 million MSMEs providing about 80 million employment opportunities, contributing to 
about 8% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and about 33% of total manufacturing output 
(Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, 2018). 
Some of the major challenges faced by MSMEs in the adoption of internet marketing and e-commerce identified from the interviews were: 
1. Lack of adequate awareness and skills 
2. Financial constraints and budgetary restrictions
3. Quality of products or services 
4. Lack of adequate technical resources 
5. Security concerns 

### Our approach to this problem
After understanding the problems or challenges faced by MSME, we came to the conclusion that 
they need a simple platform which is less expensive, easy to understand, a proper billing system, 
application for better value realization so, in our project we are giving them these facilities in one 
platform, we are providing them an E-commerce website and a mobile app in which the seller can 
register with general doc. Like Aadhaar card of proprietor; pan of proprietor there is no need of 
GST no. and other documents. It will be a key benefit for sellers as some MSME don’t have GST no. 
because their turnover is less than 40lakhs so they can also take the benefits of our platform. 
We are using AI technology for preferring the nearest local seller to sell their products, nearest local 
vendors will get the more precedence over other vendors and this will provide lots of benefits to 
the seller. 
We are using AI technology for realizing better value of products. There will be a cost price from 
seller’s side and after evaluating product our system will decide what will be the better value of 
selling price. 
There will also be a visit to seller option in our portal so that buyer can directly visit vendor to 
check the product quality. As it is possible because we are promoting nearest local vendors. 
There will be no cash on delivery option so that seller can get assurance of value of their product. 
For security concern we are making just a single agreement that if the business information is false 
then legal action will be take. And no other agreement will be made 
For using our portal you just need active internet connection in smart phone or PC then you can 
easily access our portal Unique billing system in our portal will allow seller to access it any time and 
no need to keeping records for sale purchase it. 
Through our portal the MSME sector can also purchase raw material. As in our portal anyone can 
register and sell their products. 
At last, we are using chat bot for better user experience.
